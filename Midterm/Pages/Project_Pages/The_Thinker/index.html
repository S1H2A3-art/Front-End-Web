      <h3><i>Final Proposal</i></h3>
      <h3>Project title: The Thinker</h3>

<p><strong>One sentence description:</strong> An entirely real-time AI-simulated character using RAG and other image generation/sound generation models that respond to user inputs in forms of sound and text.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A project that creates an infinitely intelligent character: the thinker, based on the image of the thinker statue in my profile picture. The idea is to turn the stone statue into an animated, interactive, and responsive AI character by simulating its thoughts using an RAG(perhaps multi-modal for image also) that connects data from the most profound philosophical texts to an OpenAI LLM model. I will apply OpenAI embedding to turn these texts into machine-understandable language and store this data using a Qdrant vector library that is accessible to an LLM. After receiving input from the user(I'll think about a voice-to-text model to do that or stick to simple text inputs), the LLM will decide on an action or expression and something to utter. The image of the thinker will be generated in units of a set of alternating images(like a stop motion GIF), similar to At the Dawn of the World. This is intended to reduce the computation and time needed to generate the images and increase the coherence and fluency of the experience, as the movement of the character will change only after the next set of 5 images is generated. I wish to make the character aware of its environment and perhaps respond to changes in the environment that might either be introduced in a hard-coded way or by the user in some shape or form yet to be decided.</p>

<p><strong>Inspiration:</strong> I have been interested in the technologies involved in simulating consciousness since last semester: <a href="https://s1h2a3-art.github.io/Front-End-Web/Midterm/Pages/Project_Pages/The_Guidebook_for_the_Conscious_Book/index.html?concept=consciousness&project=The%20Guidebook%20for%20the%20Conscious%20Book">The Guidebook to the Conscious Book</a>. Yet, I didn't have access to the necessary technologies and tools last semester, and I simply used some LLM with modified character prompts. This year, I experimented with RAG to develop an AI assistant for my portfolio website(since I didn't have much data to try fine-tuning) and found it to be really easy to use and pretty powerful. I want to try experimenting with it to animate a character that I think will be very fun to interact with and who fits the intrinsically knowledgeable and intellectual nature of an RAG. This is why I decided to experiment with the mascot of my website and the figure who has been in my profile picture for the last couple of years: the thinker. It will also be very fun to see it moving or being responsive(I am thinking if I should use a multi-modal RAG for more consistent image generation) and observe it behave in ways that undermine the traditional stereotypes around a hermit, profound thinker figure.</p>

<p><strong>Visual Reference:</strong></p>
<p>The way of animating is inspired by the technique that I used for At the Dawn of the World, though I seek to make it generated in real-time and much smarter and more responsive.</p>
<p>The character of the thinker should look something like this:</p>
<custom-spacing size = "3rem"></custom-spacing>
<img src="../../../Assets/icon.jpeg">
<custom-spacing size = "3rem"></custom-spacing>
<img src="page_asset/img2.jpeg">
<custom-spacing size = "3rem"></custom-spacing>

<p>I am planning to situate the figure in a 3D environment. </p>
<custom-spacing size = "3rem"></custom-spacing>
<img src="page_asset/img1.jpg">
<custom-spacing size = "3rem"></custom-spacing>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong> This project is mostly for my own entertainment, though I think it'll be very fun to interacti with</p>

<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Generating images in a 3D environment and maintaining a similar dimension. I have to do some testing on this to make sure it works.</li>
<li>Consistency in image generation and RAG character simulation</li>
<li>Fluency with so many data files to retrieve from APIs</li>
</ul>
