      <h2>Documentation</h2>
      <h3>Explanation</h3>
      <p>The program will let users enter prompts in the format of: let there be [notion]. The enter button will be linked to an askAI function that sends the prompt that includes the question to three different LLMs(Gemini, Claude, and Grok) with three distinct character settings. The AIs are asked to define each concept and provide a rigorous proof of why their definitions are the most accurate. Then, after all responses are loaded, the function will loop through each response in turn and convert them into speech generated by ElevenLabs. Meanwhile, the three text responses will be sent to ChatGPT to be further assessed. ChatGPT will determine which AI defines the notion best, what category the notion belongs to(existence, selfhood, knowledge, ethics, meaning, or freedom), and draw a conclusion to the current stage of affairs. The conclusion will be read by ElevenLabs AI after all three spoke. Then, the next iteration will begin, and the user will be asked again to enter a prompt. The program only ends(the world is successfully created) when each of the 6 categories has had at least one example.</p>
