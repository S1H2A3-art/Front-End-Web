      <h3><i>Final Presentation</i></h3>
      <p><strong>One sentence description:</strong>The Thinker is a mini AI-integrated, web-based interactive experience
        in which the user attempts to escape from the mind of an autonomous AI character—the Thinker—by inducing a
        mental breakdown through conversation.
      </p>

      <h3>Project Summary</h3>
      <p>While navigating the About page of Shawn’s portfolio website, users encounter a collage of newspaper and
        magazine clippings forming the image of the Thinker. I originally created this collage in high school, and it
        has since served as my profile picture and now my website’s icon. When the cursor hovers over the image, the
        pointer changes to a hand icon, though no interaction occurs. However, if the user’s cursor lingers for long
        enough, the surrounding elements on the page gradually fade away. The Thinker’s image then slowly emerges at the
        center, accompanied by an input bar and a button inviting the user to begin a conversation with the Thinker,
        thereby activating the project.</p>
      <p>At first, the user is left directionless, given no instructions and being forced abruptly into an unfamiliar
        scenario. Through conversation with the Thinker, they will begin to notice that certain prompts cause a bar in
        the top-left corner to fill. Over time, they will realize that the bar increases whenever the Thinker is pushed
        to think, reflect, or contemplate profound philosophical questions. As the Thinker grows irritated by these
        prompts, his image gradually becomes distorted and less intelligible, and his speech turns more radical and
        hysterical. Once the bar fills completely, the Thinker undergoes a full mental breakdown, releasing the user
        from the experience and returning them to the About page.
      </p>

      <h3>Inspiration & Process</h3>
      <p>Originally, this project was inspired by one of my earlier works, <a
          href="../The_Guidebook_for_the_Conscious_Book/index.html?project=The%20Guidebook%20for%20the%20Conscious%20Book">The
          Guidebook for the Conscious Book</a>, which explored the simulation of an expanding consciousness that evolves
        through user interaction. Building on that concept, I wanted to create an autonomous AI character whose
        narrative centers on being trapped within a webpage—and who ultimately relies on the user’s actions to break
        free.</p>
      <p>I began by implementing the technical foundations necessary to make a real-time, generative AI character
        possible. The system is illustrated in the diagram below:
      </p>
      <img src="page_asset/img4.png">
      <p>The webpage processes the user’s input and sends it to an n8n workflow along with a set of system prompts.
        These prompts, stored in a JSON file, define the core logic of the Thinker and are selected dynamically based on
        the Thinker’s current state—particularly his irritation level. An AI agent then determines both the Thinker's
        image prompt and its textual response to the user.

      <p>Initially, I considered fine-tuning a language model to achieve more consistent speech patterns and to better
        simulate an autonomous consciousness. However, fine-tuning is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and may
        still fail to produce the precise behavior I had in mind. Instead, I chose to simulate the appearance of a
        character through rigorous prompt engineering to determine its personality, tone, appearances, etc.
      </p>

      <p>After the LLM processes the data, the Thinker’s textual response is displayed directly on the page, while its
        image prompt is constructed in JavaScript based on the Thinker’s emotional state, facial expression, and implied
        actions. This constructed image prompt is then sent to a separate n8n workflow that:
      </p>
      <img src="page_asset/img5.png">
      <ol>
        <li>Generates a reference image from the prompt.</li>
        <li>Produces five additional images similar to the reference.</li>
        <li>Removes the backgrounds from all five images.</li>
        <li>Returns the processed images to the webpage.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>A pixelation effect is then applied to the five images, which are displayed in rapid alternation to create the
        impression of subtle movement and animation.
        The pixelation effect uses <a
          href="https://github.com/S1H2A3-art/Front-End-Web/blob/main/Portfolio%20Website/Pages/About_Page/The%20Thinker/Grid.js">Grid.js</a>,
        which is something that I made for one of my previous projects: <a
          href="../Zero_Gravity_Theatre:_The_Brothers_Karamazov/index.html?project=Zero%20Gravity%20Theatre%3A%20The%20Brothers%20Karamazov">Zero
          Gravity Theatre: The Brothers Karamazov</a>.</p>

      <p>As I continued developing the project, I realized that completing it would require an extensive amount of time
        refining the narrative and designing the AI character—much of which would need to be hard-coded and not
        AI-related. Achieving the level of polish I envisioned would demand work in animation, storytelling, character
        design, and other areas I am not yet fully prepared to explore. This is also when I recognized that, for now, it
        would be more practical to shift my focus toward building an AI assistant for my portfolio website instead.
      </p>
      <p>With that in mind, I decided to preserve the existing technical framework and ensure that it functions
        reliably, rather than investing heavily in story development or visual characterization at this stage. I plan to
        revisit and expand this project in the future—perhaps for my nonlinear storytelling class—once I have more time
        and experience to focus on the narrative aspects.
      </p>
      <h3>Audience/Context</h3>
      <p>In its current form, the project is hidden within my portfolio website as an easter egg—an approach I expect to
        maintain as the project evolves, since it aligns naturally with the character’s backstory. For now, it serves
        primarily as a playful, unexpected interaction for visitors exploring the site. As I continue to develop the
        narrative, however, I hope to expand the project’s philosophical depth, encouraging users to reflect on ethical
        and metaphysical questions surrounding how an AI might experience reality from a first-person perspective,
        including its emotions, limitations, and sense of self.</p>

      <h3>User Testing</h3>
      <p>Originally, the Thinker image was interactive—its scale would gradually shrink as the user hovered over it. A
        friend suggested making the activation logic more subtle by removing these visual cues, allowing the encounter
        to feel more unexpected and exciting
      </p>
      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Further enrich the storytelling and deepen the Thinker’s character.</li>
        <li>Enhance user interaction by integrating voice generation through ElevenLabs.</li>
        <li>Increase the Thinker’s autonomy so it can speak or think even without user input.</li>
        <li>Allow the Thinker to move across the webpage independently.</li>
        <li>Add a countdown mechanism that periodically refreshes the Thinker’s memory.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3><i>Final Proposal</i></h3>
      <h3>Project title: The Thinker</h3>

      <p><strong>One sentence description:</strong> An entirely real-time AI-simulated character using RAG and other
        image generation/sound generation models that respond to user inputs in forms of sound and text.</p>

      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A project that creates an infinitely intelligent character: the thinker, based on
        the image of the thinker statue in my profile picture. The idea is to turn the stone statue into an animated,
        interactive, and responsive AI character by simulating its thoughts using an RAG(perhaps multi-modal for image
        also) that connects data from the most profound philosophical texts to an OpenAI LLM model. I will apply OpenAI
        embedding to turn these texts into machine-understandable language and store this data using a Qdrant vector
        library that is accessible to an LLM. After receiving input from the user(I'll think about a voice-to-text model
        to do that or stick to simple text inputs), the LLM will decide on an action or expression and something to
        utter. The image of the thinker will be generated in units of a set of alternating images(like a stop motion
        GIF), similar to At the Dawn of the World. This is intended to reduce the computation and time needed to
        generate the images and increase the coherence and fluency of the experience, as the movement of the character
        will change only after the next set of 5 images is generated. I wish to make the character aware of its
        environment and perhaps respond to changes in the environment that might either be introduced in a hard-coded
        way or by the user in some shape or form yet to be decided.</p>

      <p><strong>Inspiration:</strong> I have been interested in the technologies involved in simulating consciousness
        since last semester: <a
          href="https://s1h2a3-art.github.io/Front-End-Web/Midterm/Pages/Project_Pages/The_Guidebook_for_the_Conscious_Book/index.html?concept=consciousness&project=The%20Guidebook%20for%20the%20Conscious%20Book">The
          Guidebook to the Conscious Book</a>. Yet, I didn't have access to the necessary technologies and tools last
        semester, and I simply used some LLM with modified character prompts. This year, I experimented with RAG to
        develop an AI assistant for my portfolio website(since I didn't have much data to try fine-tuning) and found it
        to be really easy to use and pretty powerful. I want to try experimenting with it to animate a character that I
        think will be very fun to interact with and who fits the intrinsically knowledgeable and intellectual nature of
        an RAG. This is why I decided to experiment with the mascot of my website and the figure who has been in my
        profile picture for the last couple of years: the thinker. It will also be very fun to see it moving or being
        responsive(I am thinking if I should use a multi-modal RAG for more consistent image generation) and observe it
        behave in ways that undermine the traditional stereotypes around a hermit, profound thinker figure.</p>

      <p><strong>Visual Reference:</strong></p>
      <p>The way of animating is inspired by the technique that I used for At the Dawn of the World, though I seek to
        make it generated in real-time and much smarter and more responsive.</p>
      <p>The character of the thinker should look something like this:</p>

      <p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Generating images in a 3D environment and maintaining a similar dimension. I have to do some testing on this
          to make sure it works.</li>
        <li>Consistency in image generation and RAG character simulation</li>
        <li>Fluency with so many data files to retrieve from APIs</li>
      </ul>
